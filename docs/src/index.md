# Atmosphere

Atmosphere is a lightweight SQL framework designed for sustainable,
database-reliant systems. It leverages Rust's powerful type and macro systems
to derive SQL schemas from your rust struct definitions into an advanced trait
system.

It works by leveraging the [`sqlx`][] crate and the Rust macro system to allow
you to work easily with relational-database mapped entities, while still
enabling low level usage of the underlying `sqlx` concepts.
