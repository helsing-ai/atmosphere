# Traits

Given that you have derived `Schema` for your entities, Atmosphere provides you
with some traits for simple CRUD operations on your database. These make it
very straightforward to do simple operations, but keep in mind that you are
always able to reach down and write raw SQL manually where it makes sense.

Here are the traits that Atmosphere exposes, along with some examples:

* [Create](crate.md)
* [Read](read.md)
* [Update](update.md)
* [Delete](delete.md)
