# Delete

The [`Delete`] trait allows you to read entities from rows in your table. Here is
an example of how to create a user, given that you have derived its [`Schema`]:

```rust
# extern crate atmosphere;
# extern crate sqlx;
# extern crate tokio;
# use atmosphere::prelude::*;
#[derive(Schema, Debug, PartialEq)]
#[table(schema = "public", name = "user")]
struct User {
    #[sql(pk)]
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    #[sql(unique)]
    email: String,
}

# async fn test() -> std::result::Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let database = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL").unwrap();
let pool = atmosphere::Pool::connect(&database).await?;

// find user by primary key
let mut user = User::find(&pool, &0).await?;

// delete user data
user.delete(&pool).await?;

// delete by primary key
User::delete_by(&pool, &4).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
# fn main() {}
```
