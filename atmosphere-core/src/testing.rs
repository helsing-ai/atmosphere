//! Provides functions for automated database testing.
//!
//! This module contains asynchronous functions to test the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
//! operations on database entities. It ensures that these operations are executed correctly and that
//! the data integrity is maintained throughout the process.
